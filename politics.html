			<h2>New Delhi :</h2>
			<p>
				About 13,000 lives have been saved by good samaritans under the Delhi government's "Farishtey Dilli Ke" scheme, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on saturday.
			</p>
			<p>
				The scheme, launched in October 2019, encourages people to rescue those who have met with road accidents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Addressing an event at the Thyagaraj Stadium, Kejriwal said, in some cases it becomes difficult for medical aid to reach an area during an emergency because of congestion.
				"But, under our 'Farishtey Dilli Ke' scheme, this issue is being addressed. About 13,000 human lives have been saved so 
				far, under this scheme," he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the scheme, the Delhi government incurs the expenditure for treating eligible road accident victims and gives incentives to those who helped them.
				In February 2021, Kejriwal tweeted that over 10,000 lives had been saved under the scheme.
				"People are coming forward to help each other. You should also help those who met with any road accident. To save
				someone's life is a pious act," Kejriwal had tweeted.
