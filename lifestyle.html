				Summer beauty tips: While it's fun to get dolled up with a full face of foundation and bright red lips on special occasions, there are times when you just want to look and feel your best with a no-makeup makeup look. Here's how to achieve this look in just 5 minutes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If there is one makeup look that looks great on all skin tone or all skin types without the help of a makeup artist or a beauty guru, it has to be the no-makeup makeup look which essentially requires a little bit of makeup and beauty efforts to get that effortless look while seeming natural like no makeup is involved. While it's fun to get dolled up with a full face of foundation and bright or bold red lips on special occasions to ooze oomph, there are times when you just want to look and feel your best and that's when a no-makeup makeup look can save the day!
			</p>

				According to Manasa Garemella, Co-Founder, kindlife, the key to nailing a no-makeup makeup look is to hydrate your skin. She advised, “Start with putting a generous amount of moisturizer and let it soak in. The skin needs to be well moisturized to nail that look. To begin with, prep your skin with an illuminating or a hydrating primer. According to me, ditch the foundation for this look but one can surely use a lightweight foundation with minimal layering.”
			</p>
			<p>
				She added, “Use concealer to strategically cover those blemishes and achieve an even-toned glow. Apply a generous amount of blush of your choice to make those cheekbones look more prominent. End it with a glossy nude or pink lip tint and use the same shade for your eyes as well and you have your natural-looking no-makeup-makeup look!”

Bringing her expertise to the same, Jayati Goel, Founder of Hanoor, listed 5 tips to achieve the no-makeup makeup look this summer:
